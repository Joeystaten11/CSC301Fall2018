# Unit 3: Functions, and more SQL commands

In Unit 2, we learned a little about aggregate functions such as ```count()``` and ```sum()```. 
Those are useful for aggregating results for an entire table or subset of a table. 
But SQL also has a bunch of other functions to help us manipulate how the data in our 
result set is displayed or how our queries run. The functions we will cover here are 
non-aggregate functions. They are applied on a row-by-row, column-by-column basis.

In this Unit, we will also learn about new ways to manipulate the data in the database. We saw 
some of these such as INSERT and UPDATE very briefly back in Unit 1, but here we will delve deeper.
