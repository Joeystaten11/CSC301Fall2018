## 2.4 LIMIT
```LIMIT``` is a MySQL-only keyword that allows you to give a range for the rows to be returned. PhpMyAdmin adds it onto your result sets when it displays them so that it can give you a paginated 30-rows-per-page view of your result set.
You can also use ```LIMIT``` whenever you like to place a hard limit on how many records are displayed.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM someTable
LIMIT 100;
```

You can also specify the start point and how many records to return. This will return rows 51-150:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM someTable
LIMIT 50,100;
```
