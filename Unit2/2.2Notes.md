## 2.2 Column and table aliases
Sometimes we want to change the way a column is displayed. We can use a Column "alias" to do this. Example:
```sql
SELECT lastname as 'ln'
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname NOT LIKE '%m';
```
Tables can also be aliased. Here is an example, which you might not find very interesting right now, but later when we move into JOINs you will need it.
```sql
SELECT s.lastname
FROM someTable s
WHERE firstname LIKE '%m';
```
Sometimes you will also see the keyword ```AS``` used for this purpose:
```sql
SELECT lastname
FROM someTable AS s
WHERE firstname NOT LIKE '%m';
```
You may also see the entire table name prefixed in front of a column name:
```sql
SELECT sometable.lastname
FROM someTable
WHERE firstname LIKE '%m';
```
