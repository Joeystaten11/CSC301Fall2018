## 2.3 Order By
An ```ORDER BY``` clause in a ```SELECT``` query tells how we would like the result set ordered. It is followed by a list of columns, left to right, and either ASC or DESC. (ASC is the default so you can leave it off)
* You CAN use column aliases in the ```ORDER BY```.
* You CAN mix ```ASC``` and ```DESC```. 
* You CAN order by something you didn't ```SELECT```.

### Example: Ordering by a column we didn't select.
```sql
SELECT lastname
FROM someTable
ORDER BY firstname DESC;
```

### Example: ordering by two different things in two different orders, and one thing we didn't select:
```sql
SELECT lastname, firstname
FROM someTable
ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 DESC, middlename ASC;
```
