## 2.2 Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions include ```min()```, ```max()```, ```avg()```, ```sum()```, and my personal favorite ```count()```. The noun "aggregate" means "collection".

To apply the aggregate function, just call it on a column name, like this:
```sql
SELECT count(Language)
FROM countryLanguage;
```
The result of a simple count is just a number.

Here are some other ways to use aggregate queries. 
#### Example: "Give me the highest priced item I sell":
```sql
SELECT max(price)
FROM products;
```
#### Example: "Give me the date of the earliest order":
```sql
SELECT min(order_date)
FROM orders;
```
You can also add an alias to make the display of an aggregate function look nicer:
```sql
SELECT count(students) as 'total number of students'
FROM databaseClassRoster;
```
### 2.2.1 Aggregate functions with a category or "group"
We use group by when there is an additional grouping column, for example that we want to use as a label for a category, to which the aggregated function will be applied:
```sql
SELECT Language, count(Language)
FROM CountryLanguage
GROUP BY Language;
```
The result is both the Language AND the count for each one. Another example:
```sql
SELECT Language, avg(Percentage) 
FROM CountryLanguage
GROUP BY Language;
```
A shortcut:
```sql
SELECT Language, avg(Percentage)
FROM CountryLanguage
GROUP BY 1;
```
### 2.2.2 Rules of Group By
1. Don't use "group by" unless you need it! 
1. And you will usually only need it when you're doing an aggregate function.
1. When you group, you **must** "group by" everything else on the top line, aside from the aggregate function itself.

What happens when you leave off the group by?
```sql
SELECT Continent, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country;
```
The fix:
```sql
SELECT Continent, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1;
```
What happens when you only group by one of the non-aggregate columns on the top line:
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY 1;
```
The fix:
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
### 2.2.3 Thinking about Efficiency
Compare the result time for the following queries as reported by PhpMyAdmin:
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
--versus--
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY Continent, Region;
```

Which one is reported to be faster? When does this matter? All the time or some of the time?

### 2.2.4 GROUP BY and HAVING
```HAVING``` works with ```GROUP BY``` to reduce the list to only results meeting some threshold **after** aggregating.

#### Example: "List cities and count hotels, but only show the ones where I have counted more than 3 hotels in the city."

Without ```HAVING``` (shows all cities, even those with < 3 hotels)
```sql
SELECT city, count(hno) 
FROM hotel
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```
With ```HAVING``` (shows only the cities we asked for, those with >= 3) 
```sql
SELECT city, count(hno) 
FROM hotel
GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(hno) >= 3  -- note you can't use the column number here!
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```
The following query will not work; why?
```sql
SELECT city, count(hno) 
FROM hotel
GROUP BY 1 
HAVING 2 >= 3     -- error here
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```
Please only use ```HAVING``` when you need it. Many times you will see examples that try to use ```HAVING``` just like a ```WHERE```. But it is **supposed** to have a different purpose. Compare its efficiency.
