### 2.6.1 Aggregate functions with a category or "group"
We use group by when there is an additional grouping column, for example that we want to use as a label for a category, to which the aggregated function will be applied:
```sql
SELECT Language, count(Language)
FROM CountryLanguage
GROUP BY Language;
```
The result is both the Language AND the count for each one. Another example:
```sql
SELECT Language, avg(Percentage) 
FROM CountryLanguage
GROUP BY Language;
```
A shortcut:
```sql
SELECT Language, avg(Percentage)
FROM CountryLanguage
GROUP BY 1;
```
