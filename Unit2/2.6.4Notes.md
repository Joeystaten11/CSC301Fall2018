### 2.6.4 GROUP BY and HAVING
```HAVING``` works with ```GROUP BY``` to reduce the list to only results meeting some threshold **after** aggregating.

#### Example: 

Without ```HAVING``` (shows all continents)
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
With ```HAVING``` (shows only the continents with more than one country) 
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(Code) > 5
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
The following query will not work; why?
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
HAVING 2 > 1 -- here we try to use the column number shortcut "2" for count(Code)
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
You can't use the column number shortcuts in a HAVING clause.

Also, please only use ```HAVING``` when you need it. Many times you will see examples that try to use ```HAVING``` just like a ```WHERE```. But it is **supposed** to have a different purpose. Compare its efficiency.

#### Difference between ```WHERE``` and ```HAVING```

```WHERE``` filters out rows **before** the aggregating has hapened, ```HAVING``` filters out rows **after** the aggregate function has been applied.

```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
WHERE Continent LIKE 'A%' -- this filters out Continents BEFORE counting
GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(Code) > 5 -- this filters them out AFTER counting
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
