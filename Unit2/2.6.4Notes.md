### 2.6.4 GROUP BY and HAVING
```HAVING``` works with ```GROUP BY``` to reduce the list to only results meeting some threshold **after** aggregating.

#### Example: "List cities and count hotels, but only show the ones where I have counted more than 3 hotels in the city."

Without ```HAVING``` (shows all cities, even those with < 3 hotels)
```sql
SELECT city, count(hno) 
FROM hotel
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```
With ```HAVING``` (shows only the cities we asked for, those with >= 3) 
```sql
SELECT city, count(hno) 
FROM hotel
GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(hno) >= 3  -- note you can't use the column number here!
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```
The following query will not work; why?
```sql
SELECT city, count(hno) 
FROM hotel
GROUP BY 1 
HAVING 2 >= 3     -- error here
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```
Please only use ```HAVING``` when you need it. Many times you will see examples that try to use ```HAVING``` just like a ```WHERE```. But it is **supposed** to have a different purpose. Compare its efficiency.
