## 2.6 Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions include ```min()```, ```max()```, ```avg()```, ```sum()```, and my personal favorite ```count()```. The noun "aggregate" means "collection".

### 2.6.0 Simple aggregates
To apply the aggregate function, just call it on a column name, like this:
```sql
SELECT count(SpokenLanguage)
FROM CountryLanguage;
```
The result of a simple count is just a number.

Here are some other ways to use aggregate queries. 
#### Example: "Give me the highest priced item I sell":
```sql
SELECT max(Population)
FROM Country;
```
#### Example: "Give me the date of the earliest order":
```sql
SELECT min(IndepYear)
FROM Country;
```
You can also add an alias to make the display of an aggregate function look nicer:
```sql
SELECT count(Continent) as 'total number of students'
FROM Country;
```
